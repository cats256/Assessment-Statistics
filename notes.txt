Why the logit normal?
Upper and lower bounded. Skewed. Research paper showed above shows it best fit. The logit normal is basically the normal distribution with the inverse logit function, also known as expit or logistic function, applied to it with turns the range of the distribution from [-infinity, infinity] to [0, 1]. One can intuitively think of the grade distribution as scaled logit-normal distribution where a function similar to the logistic function is applied to students' preparedness (or competency or effort or smartness) distribution, which is assumed to be approximately normal, to convert it into grades, where the range is restricted [minimum_possible_score, max_possible_score] where it is much harder to move up than to move down, think the effort it takes trying to go from a 70 average on exams to 80 averages compared to from 80 averages to 90 averages, something about diminishing return, likewise, the difference between the underlying value normal distribution for 0.5 in a logit normal vs 0.6 in a logit normal is much more different than 0.6 and 0.7 
How should I fit the logit normal? Don't use 90th percentile or more unless your sample is at least 100, never use max and minimum score obtained
Apply the logistic function, inverse logit normal, to get the mean. One can also think of the logistic function, as a function representing diminishing return.

Short Answer: The logit-normal is bounded, allows for skewness, and takes into account diminishing returns. Research paper from Stanford Computer Science, in collaboration with GradeScope, showed the logit-normal outperforms the normal, truncated normal, and beta distribution.

Long answer:
There are many distributions that may come to mind when people think about the supposed distribution of grades. The most commonly being the normal. However, the normal is unbounded, range [-infinity, infinity], while grades are bounded, range [min_possible_score, max_possible_score]. One must then narrow down to bounded distributions, some of which are the truncated normal, the beta distribution, the binomial distribution, continuous analog of the binomial, and the logit-normal. The truncated normal is, then, eliminated due to its lack of skewness, whereas grade distribution is often skewed and asymmetric. The binomial is also eliminated due to its discrete nature, which lacks flexibillity. This left us with the beta distribution, the continuous analog of the binomial, and the logit-normal. The logit-normal, reasoning wise, is the best among the three considering that it is characterized by the logistic function, which takes into account diminishing return. This is reinforced by a research paper from Stanford Computer Science, in collaboration with GradeScope, [insert link] showing that the logit-normal outperforms the normal, truncated normal, and beta distribution. Anecdotally, I have also tested the logit-normal against the distributions mentioned including the continuous binomial analog, and found that is it the superior distribution in terms of goodness of fit.

Intuitively, one can think of students' abilities distribution as an approximate normal distribution but with range from [0, infinity], where it is converted into the grade distribution through an unknown function. This function takes into account diminishing return (think about the amount of effort it would take to go from a 50 to a 70 on exam, as opposed to from a 70 to a 90) and compresses an infinite range [0, infinity] into a bounded range [min_possible_score, max_possible_score]. The logistic function, similarly, also represents a function characterized by diminishing return and transform an infinite range into a bounded range, albeit from [-infinity, infinity] to [0, 1]. One can intuitively understand and see the similarity between the grade distribution and the logit-normal distribution, which arises from applying the logistic function (resembling the unknown function characterized by diminishing returns and bounded range) onto a normal distribution (resembling the students' abilities distribution).
